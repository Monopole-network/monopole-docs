Monopole supports Impact Projects to measure their profitable and sustainable performance in a reliable and decentralized process. We give users full visibility on innovations in a decentralised way.

## Why Monopole?

86% Impact investing startups fail to meet expectations from both sides

### Investors

- Are lost in the jungle & underserved in terms of experience

- Challenging sourcing of actually sustainable projects

- Limited transparency on projectsâ€™ impact & performance

- Boring investment & monitoring process of project through project lifespan 


### Impact entrepreneurs

- Face funding gap & lack of visibility

- Defective funding resources at launch & poor interface with investors throughout project lifecycle

- Absence of smart opportunities to get value-adding advice & scale up

- Restrained visibility, recognition and access to next gen tech leverages
